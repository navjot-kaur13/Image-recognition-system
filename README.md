#  Image Recognition with Machine Learning  

This project implements an "Image Recognition System" using classical "machine learning algorithms":  
-  "Decision Tree"  
-  "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)"  
-  "Naïve Bayes"

It compares the performance of these models on an image-based dataset using **10-fold cross-validation** and evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  


##  Abstract
Image recognition is a crucial part of "computer vision" that enables machines to classify visual data.  
This project evaluates three machine learning algorithms for image recognition tasks.  
By comparing their accuracy and confusion matrices, we demonstrate how different models perform on the same dataset.  


##  Features
- Image preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Implementation of "Decision Tree, KNN, and Naïve Bayes" classifiers  
- "K-Fold Cross Validation" for robust evaluation  
- Confusion matrices and classification reports  
- Visualization of fold-wise accuracy  


##  Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree Classifier (rule-based classification)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (distance-based classification)  
- Naïve Bayes (probabilistic classification)


# Future Scope
Extend to deep learning models (CNN, RNN, GANs)
Use transfer learning (ResNet, VGG, Inception)
Explore hybrid models for better performance
Improve interpretability with Explainable AI
